# CSCI-499

## To run Program:
This application consists of a React frontend and two backend servers - one implemented in Node.js and the other in Flask (Python).

Navigate to the directory containing the application.

To start the Node.js backend server:
`node server.js`

In another terminal start the Flask backend server:
`python app.py`

In another terminal start the React frontend app:
`npm start App.js`

You will then be sent to the login screen where you can login or create an account to gain access to the dashboard with all of its functionality.

## Set-Up
Make a virtual environment (venv) and activate it
Install the Python packages using the following command:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

In app.py, provide Path to client_secret.json file. 
  
For more details on how to set up a react app there are instructions below.
Replace the public and src files with the ones you pulled from github

### API keys
#### OpenAPI
- Get an API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Go to constants.py and change the variable APIKEY with the secret key given on the website
- If this doesn't work then contact one of us

#### GoogleAPI
- Client_secret.json is provided with the necessary key
- When the program is first run you will have to go through authentication proccess that will start with a window opening in your browser
- If you receive a prompt that says "Google hasnâ€™t verified this app", click continue to give 
- If you receive a prompt that says "Access blocked: CSCI499 App has not completed the Google verification process", send one of us a message with the email that you are using for this authentication so we can added you as one of the test users on the Google console
- If you recieve an error about the token try to delete the token files folder and restart the app

#### Spotify API
- Get the Client_ID and Client_Secret at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
- Go to constants.py and change the corrisponding variables with your own and also get your Spotify username
and paste it into the associated variable(you can find your username by going to Edit profile on your account page)
- when create your first playlist the app will redirect you to a page where you have to allow access to
create a playlist on you spotify account, in the terminal it will ask you to input the url, just copy and
paste the url of the page you were redirected too and paste it in the terminal


## Bugs/Issues
- There may be connection/auth issue when sending an email via user dashboard.
- Chatbot may give incorrect information as it will try to give filler text instead of looking at your calendar
- Some buttons do not or features on the app are not fully implemented and may not trigger any action when clicked. They will be available in future updates
- Users may lose authentication upon page refresh or when navigating back to Dashboard from certain URLs. Users will be redirected to Login Page, and have to log back in.
We plan to fix these in the future.

## Tests 
- Unit test functions for app.py Chatbot.py GoogleCalendar.py and Spotify.py are in the appropriate test file. These tests can run by using python -m unittest test_spotify.py substituting the name with whatever file you want to test
- test_app.py
- test_chatbot.py
- test_google_calendar.py
- test_spotify.py

- Frontend responsive and reactive on major desktop / mobile display sizes correctly. Tested with multiple user agents such firefox, chrome, and safari.
- Tested react components and they all render.
- Tested DB with large amount of user logins.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
